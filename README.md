# Reeborg's World

This day's exercises are done using the code learning platform, Reeborg's World. There are various challenges that to attempt. The aim was to acclimatize to the use of functions, for and while loops by using them get Karel the Robot through some scenarios.
Some did tease the mind, but they are fun to attempt.

Website is at: [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html)

The folder **Reeborg's World** contains the solutions to these scenarios.

*Things to Note*: The count of moves of the robot and logic of the code gives a good idea of how many times code is run and how efficient it is.
